# Violation Detection Refactoring Progress

## Goal
Split violation formulas from violation_detection.py into separate files for better maintainability and testing.

## Original Files
- violation_detection.py (main logic)
- violation_detection_original.py (backup reference)

## Formula Files Created ✅
- [x] violation_formulas/article_85d.py
- [x] violation_formulas/article_85f.py
- [x] violation_formulas/article_85f_ns.py
- [x] violation_formulas/article_85f_5th.py
- [x] violation_formulas/article_85g.py
- [x] violation_formulas/max12.py
- [x] violation_formulas/max60.py
- [x] violation_formulas/formula_utils.py

## Functions Moved ✅
- [x] detect_85d_violations -> article_85d.py
- [x] detect_85f_violations -> article_85f.py
- [x] detect_85f_ns_violations -> article_85f_ns.py
- [x] detect_85f_5th_violations -> article_85f_5th.py
- [x] detect_85g_violations -> article_85g.py
- [x] detect_MAX_12 -> max12.py
- [x] detect_MAX_60 -> max60.py
- [x] process_moves_vectorized -> formula_utils.py
- [x] prepare_data_for_violations -> formula_utils.py

## Core Functions Maintained in violation_detection.py ✅
- [x] detect_violations (dispatcher)
- [x] get_violation_remedies (aggregator)
- [x] register_violation (decorator)

## Testing Steps Completed ✅
- [x] Verified each violation type works independently
- [x] Tested display indicators
- [x] Confirmed remedy calculations
- [x] Validated move processing
- [x] Checked list status handling
- [x] Fixed own_route_hours calculation for WAL/NL carriers

## Improvements Made
1. Created formula_utils.py for shared utility functions
2. Fixed own_route_hours calculation to use total_hours - off_route_hours
3. Maintained consistent handling of OTDL/PTF carriers
4. Improved code organization with clear module responsibilities

## Next Steps
1. Commit all changes to feature/split-violation-formulas branch
2. Run final tests to verify all functionality
3. Consider creating unit tests for formula_utils.py
4. Update documentation to reflect new structure
5. Create PR for review

## Notes
- Successfully reduced file size and improved organization
- Each violation type now has its own dedicated module
- Utility functions moved to formula_utils.py
- All tests passing and functionality preserved
- No changes needed to database or UI layers
